This is an attempt to reverse ultrasn0w 1.2.7 for iPhone3,1

Requirements
-------
Theos
ultrasn0w 1.2.7
CommCenterClassic from 5.1.1 IPSW

How can you contribute
-------
If you can reverse ARM assembly, welcome onboard ! Here is a brief of what you can do:

- Reverse `_writeWord` function.
- Fix the data types of `XLockHandler` and `InternalNotifications` arguments.
- Extract the unlock_strings (taking care of non-ASCII characters).
- Or just check what I've done in general.

If you can't reverse, but you own an iPhone 4 with the 1.59.00 baseband, contact me to know how you can help.
